# Jaylib - JNI bindings for [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/) 3.7

JNI is the fastest kind of native binding for Java, but is difficult to write.  Therefore
we are using [JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp) to automatically generate the bindings.
The results are not quite as Java-like
as you would get from a hand-written binding, but they are not bad, and should be easy to keep up to date
with the latest changes in Raylib.

JavaCPP is very mature and powerful but not hugely documented, so it is probably capable of doing more than we are
doing so far.
See [issues](https://github.com/electronstudio/jaylib/issues).

If there is a newer version of Raylib out then you can probably re-generate these bindings with little or no changes, because
they are auto-generated.  See [How To Build](#how-to-build)

## How to use

Download the latest [jaylib.jar](https://github.com/electronstudio/jaylib/releases/download/v3.0.0-rc5/jaylib.jar) from [releases](https://github.com/electronstudio/jaylib/releases)

Write a demo program, e.g. Demo.java

```java
import com.raylib.Jaylib.Vector3;
import com.raylib.Jaylib.Camera;
import com.raylib.Raylib;
import static com.raylib.Jaylib.*;

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        InitWindow(800, 450, "Demo");
        SetTargetFPS(60);
        Camera camera = new Camera(new Vector3(18,16,18),new Vector3(), new Vector3(0,1,0), 45, 0);
        SetCameraMode(camera, CAMERA_ORBITAL);

        while(!WindowShouldClose()){
            UpdateCamera(camera);
            BeginDrawing();
            ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);
            BeginMode3D(camera);
            DrawGrid(20, 1.0f);
            EndMode3D();
            DrawText("Hello world", 190, 200, 20, VIOLET);
            DrawFPS(20, 20);
            EndDrawing();
        }
        Raylib.CloseWindow();
    }
}
```

Compile it:

    javac -cp jaylib.jar Demo.java
    
Run it:

    java -cp jaylib.jar:. Demo
    
On MacOS you need this option:

    java -XstartOnFirstThread -cp jaylib.jar:. Demo
    
On weirdy Windows:

    java -cp jaylib.jar;. Demo

## Known issues

### Getters and setters

JavaCPP does not use the 'get' and 'set' names nor does it use public fields.  To access a field:

    var x = vector.x()

To set a field:
    
    vector.x(3)

Remember each time you do either of those you are accessing native memory.

### Constructors

JavaCPP does not generate constructors.  There are three ways you can construct objects.  The recommended JavaCPP way is like this:

     var vec = new Vector3().x(1).y(2).z(3);

I made some sub classes in Jaylib.java.  To use those:

    import com.raylib.Jaylib.Vector3;
    ...
    var vec = new Vector3(1, 2, 3);

I made some constructor functions in Jaylib.java.  To use those:

    import static com.raylib.Jaylib.Vector3;

    var vec = Vector3(1, 2, 3);

I'm undecided which of these methods is cleanest but I recommend the first because it's autogenerated by JavaCPP.

### Arrays

Arrays of C objects are not Java arrays.  For example, a `model` has an array of `materials` each
of which have an arrays of `maps`.  To access the second map of the first material:

    model.materials().position(1).maps().position(2)

## How to build

Clone this repo including submodules so you get correct version of Raylib.  (On Windows, Google for how to enable symlinks
)

    git clone --recurse-submodules  -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/electronstudio/jaylib

Build and install Raylib from the `raylib` directory.

Edit `src/com/raylib/RaylibConfig.java`.  Change the paths to the correct directories on your system.  (Yes, you would think JavaCPP could work this out for itself, or that relative paths could be used, but it seems not to work.)

Edit `build.sh` to set platform variables.

Run:
`./build.sh`

This will build you a jaylib.jar uber-jar.

On Windows the script must be run from inside a Visual C 2019 native x64 command prompt, and needs git-bash to be installed.

## License

Jaylib is distributed under the GPL license with the Classpath Exception to allow linking, the same as OpenJDK itself, so you can use it
anywhere that you use the JDK, for both free and non-free ('closed source') projects.

## Performance

Every call to C is costly, so it's slightly faster if you use Java data structures and functions when calculating
in your update loop
and then only convert them to native C data structures when you have to call the C functions for drawing.
